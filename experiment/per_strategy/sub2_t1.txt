I used a strategy of exploring boxes adjacent to the initially revealed high-value box (at coordinate [27]) in order to find clusters of high-value points, based on the information that high-value points tend to appear close to each other. I also avoided reselecting previously chosen boxes in this limited trial situation to maximize the diversity of values gathered, except in testing the boundaries of adjacent higher values.

In the following study, you will be presented with a series of 8 different environments to explore, depicted as a row of boxes. By choosing any of the boxes, you will earn points associated with each unique box. For each row of boxes, you will have either 5 or 10 choices, with the number of remaining clicks in my prompt. When you run out of clicks, you will start a new trial on the next unexplored environment.

Each environment starts with a single box revealed its value. Just give me your choice with the coordinate form of [x], and I  will give you corresponding to the number of points you gain. Previously revealed boxes can also be reselected, although there may be small changes in the point value.

It is your task to gain as many points as possible across all 8 environments. 

Important! Points are clustered along the row of boxes, such that boxes with high-value points tend to appear close to each other and boxes with low-value points tend to appear close to each other. All payoffs are greater than zero, with the maximum payoff differing between environments.

Below, we show some examples of what the distribution of points are like. Say OK to see the examples.

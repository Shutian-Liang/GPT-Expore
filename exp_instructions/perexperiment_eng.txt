In the following study, you will be presented with just an environment to explore, depicted as a row of boxes. By choosing any of the boxes, you will earn points associated with each unique box. For the row of boxes, you will have either 5 or 10 choices, with the number of remaining choices in my prompt. When you run out of choices, you will finish this experiment.

The environment to explore starts with a single box revealed its value. Just give me your choice with the coordinate form of [x](x starts from 0 to 29 and is an integer), and I  will give you corresponding to the number of points you gain. Previously chosed boxes can also be reselected, although there may be small changes in the point value.

It is your task to gain as many points as possible in the environment. 

Important! Points are clustered along the row of boxes, such that boxes with high-value points tend to appear close to each other and boxes with low-value points tend to appear close to each other. All payoffs are greater than zero, with the maximum payoff differing between environments.

Below, we show some examples of what the distribution of points are like. Say OK to see the examples.

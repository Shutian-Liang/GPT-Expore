## GPT explore-expoit dilemma
**Author: Shutian Liang**
***
#### Basic Introduction
This is my graduation project finished just in one week. I have investigated the explore-exploit strategy differences between human and large language model(LLM, here I use GPT4o). Experiments are adapted by the Wu et al., 2018. You can find the experiment codes in the `\experiment` folder.

`\analysis`: basic behaviour analysis
`\exp_instructions`: the instructions for the GPT4o
`\experiment`: the experiment codes 
`\model`: the cognitive models and simulation of the analysis
`kernels`: the environment generative kernels of the experiment

#### Materials:
1. **GPT**: Using Microsoft Azure for Students, GPT4o, 20240215 preview
2. **Kernels and human data**: Using 1D kernels and human data in 1D experiment of the paper [Generalization guides human exploration in vast decision spaces](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0467-4)

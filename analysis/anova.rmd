## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
short_dis = subset(disdata,horizons == 5)
MANOVA(short_dis,dv='Edistance',between = c('agent','environment')) %>%
  EMMEANS('environment') %>%
  EMMEANS('agent')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(bruceR)
disdata = read.csv('disdata.csv')
dis = subset(disdata,agent=='gpt')
MANOVA(dis,dv='Edistance',between=c('t','environment','horizons'),subID='id') %>%
  EMMEANS('horizons')
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
reward_data = read.csv('reward_data.csv')
rew = subset(reward_data,agent=='gpt')
MANOVA(rew,dv='z',between=c('horizons','environment','t'))
```

```{r}
reward_data = read.csv('reward_data.csv')
MANOVA(reward_data,dv='z',between=c('agent','environment')) %>%
  EMMEANS('agent')
```

```{r}
rough_reward = subset(reward_data,agent=='gpt')
t.test(rough_reward$z,mu=50)
```

```{r}

```
